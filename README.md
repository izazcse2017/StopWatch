# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

to create this project install use-timer ( npm install use-timer),
 npm install iuse timer 
### use-timer hook
The use-timer package provides a custom React hook that helps in managing timers within a React component. This hook simplifies the process of creating, starting, pausing, and resetting timers, which can be useful for various purposes like countdowns, stopwatches, or any other time-based functionality in a React application.

The useTimer hook provides an easy way to manage the timer's state, including the current time (time), the timer's status (status), and functions to control the timer (start, pause, reset).
Simplifying Timer Logic: It abstracts away the complexity of handling timer logic, such as updating the time at regular intervals and managing the timer's lifecycle.

The returned values from the useTimer hook (time, start, pause, reset, status) are used to display the timer's current value, control the timer, and show the timer's status in the UI.

### state variales of use-timer hook
Variables Returned by useTimer
time
start
pause
reset
status


-->time

Function: This variable holds the current value of the timer.
How it works: The useTimer hook internally manages the time state and updates this variable at regular intervals when the timer is running. When the timer is paused or reset, this value is accordingly adjusted.

-->start

Function: This is a function that starts or resumes the timer.
How it works: When you call start, the useTimer hook begins or continues to increment the time variable at a regular interval (usually every second). If the timer was paused, calling start will resume it from the current time.

-->pause

Function: This is a function that pauses the timer.
How it works: When you call pause, the useTimer hook stops incrementing the time variable, effectively freezing the timer at its current value. The timer can later be resumed by calling start.

-->reset

Function: This is a function that resets the timer to its initial state.
How it works: When you call reset, the useTimer hook sets the time variable back to its initial value (typically zero) and stops the timer if it was running. You can then start the timer again by calling start.

-->status

Function: This variable holds the current status of the timer.
Possible values: "RUNNING", "PAUSED", "STOPPED"
How it works: The useTimer hook updates this variable based on the actions performed. When start is called, the status is set to "RUNNING". When pause is called, the status is set to "PAUSED". After reset or if the timer hasn't been started yet, the status is "STOPPED".
